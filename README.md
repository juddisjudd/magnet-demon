### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juddisjudd/magnet-demon.git
   cd magnet-demon
   ```

2. Configure environment variables
   Create a `.env.local` file with the following:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=true  # Set to 'false' to use actual Torrust backend
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TORRUST_INDEX_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

   ```

3. Run the setup script
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   ./setup.ps1
   
   # On Linux/Mac
   ./setup.sh
   ```

Alternatively, set up manually:

1. Start Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

4. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üîê Login Credentials (Development Only)

- **Admin User**:
